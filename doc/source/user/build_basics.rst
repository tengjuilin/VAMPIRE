Build Models: The Basics
========================

In this section, we provide a basic example of building VAMPIRE models
by

-  setting up working directory
-  understanding information used to build model
-  build model using ``vampire.model.build_models``

Setting up the stage
--------------------

Suppose we have two brain slice image sets:

1. a set that has been exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)
2. a set of no treatment control

We want to build a VAMPIRE model and apply to each of the image set to
explore their morphologies. To do this, we need to build a model using
images from both sets. We can then apply the model onto each set to see
the distribution of shape modes.

Directory structure
-------------------

To achieve the goal, We setup a directory with the following structure
(suppose this is under the root directory of ``C:\`` in Windows for
convenience):

::

   |-- vampire-ogd
       |-- both
           |-- 4-50-4_40x_cortex_1_c1.tiff
           |-- ...
       |-- control
           |-- 4-50-4_40x_cortex_1_c1.tiff
           |-- ...
       |-- ogd-30min
           |-- 4-56-1_40x_cortex_1_c1.tiff
           |-- ...
       |-- build.xlsx

where

-  the ``control`` folder contains segmented images in the control group
   in ``.tiff`` files
-  the ``ogd-30min`` folder contains segmented images in the 30 min OGD
   group in ``.tiff`` files
-  the ``both`` folder contains all the same images in ``control`` and
   ``ogd-30min``
-  the ``build.xlsx`` file contains information about the images sets
   used to build models, which we will discuss below.

Image set information
---------------------

The ``build.xlsx`` file contains information of the image sets used to
build VAMPIRE models. The spreadsheet contains 6 column:

+--------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------+--------------+---------+
| img_set_path             | output_path        | model_name        | num_points | num_clusters | channel |
+==========================+====================+===================+============+==============+=========+
| ``C:\vampire-ogd\both``  | ``C:\vampire-ogd`` | control-ogd-30min | 50         | 5            | c1      |
+--------------------------+--------------------+-------------------+------------+--------------+---------+

The first 5 columns are the required columns. These columns must present
in the file to build a model:

-  ``img_set_path`` - absolute path to the directory containing the
   image set used to build model
-  ``output_path`` - absolute path to the directory used to output model
   files and figures
-  ``model_name`` - name of the image set used to build model
-  ``num_points`` - number of points used to describe object (cell or
   nuclei) contours
-  ``num_clusters`` - number of clusters used in K-means clustering;
   each cluster corresponds to a shape mode

The columns beyond the first 5 columns (in this case, column 6), are
optional columns. These columns are used to filter image filenames,
where only images with the filter tag are used in building model. For
example, we have

-  ``channel`` - the filtering type is image channel

   -  ``c1`` - only images containing the text ``c1`` are used in
      building the model.

Be sure to save and close the file to avoid potential permission error
in future steps.

Building models
---------------

Now we can start to use the ``vampire`` package to build a VAMPIRE
model. We first import necessary modules.

.. code:: python

   >>> import pandas as pd  # used to read excel file
   >>> import vampire as vp  # recommended import signature

We then read ``build.excel`` as a pandas ``DataFrame``.

.. code:: python

   >>> build_df = pd.read_excel(r'C:\vampire-ogd\build.xlsx')
   >>> build_df

   img_set_path          output_path      model_name          num_points   num_clusters   channel
   C:\vampire-ogd\both   C:\vampire-ogd   control-ogd-30min   50           5              c1

To build a VAMPIRE model, simply use the ``vampire.model.build_models``
function and pass in the ``DataFrame``.

.. code:: python

   >>> vp.model.build_models(build_df, random_state=1)

Note that we arbitrarily set the random state as 1 for reproducibility.
Depending on the amount of images used to build the model and amount of
objects in the images, the function will run for a few seconds to a few
minutes.

Resulting outputs
-----------------

Build model outputs results into the output folder and stores contour
coordinates and properties of objects in the image set folders.

Output folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The resulting outputs in the output folder ``C:\vampire-ogd`` are:

- ``shape_mode_build_control-ogd-30min.png``

    .. figure:: ../_static/img/shape_mode_build_control-ogd-30min.png
       :width: 400 px
       :align: center
       :alt: Shape mode distribution graph

    The figure contains shape mode visualization, dendrogram, and
    distribution of the build image set. As shown in the figure, the round
    orange shape mode (#2) appears the most frequent in the image set
    containing both no treatment control group and OGD 30 min group.

- ``control-ogd-30min.pickle``

    The ``.pickle`` file contains information about the VAMPIRE model. It is
    used when applying the model. For more information about the
    implementation details, refer to ``vampire.model.initialize_model``.

Image set folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The resulting outputs in the image set folder ``C:\vampire-ogd\both`` are:

- ``contour_coordinates__c1.pickle``

    The ``.pickle`` file stores information about the contour coordinates of
    objects in the image set. It can be reused when the image set is used in
    applying or building model.

- ``vampire_datasheet__c1.csv``

    The ``.csv`` file stores properties of objects in the image set, such as
    centroid coordinates, area, and aspect ratio.

Conclusion
----------

Congratulations! We have built our first VAMPIRE model. Next, weâ€™ll
look at how to apply the VAMPIRE model.
