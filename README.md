VAMPIRE (Visually Aided Morpho-Phenotyping Image Recognition) analysis quantifies and visualizes heterogeneity of cell and nucleus morphology [1]. It is used widely in analyzing microglial shape change in response to oxygen-glucose deprivation [2] and morphological changes in cancer metastasis [3].

[`vampire-analysis`](https://pypi.org/project/vampire-analysis/) provides a reproducible, fully-documented, and easy-to-use Python package that is based on the method and software used the in [`vampireanalysis`](https://pypi.org/project/vampireanalysis/) GUI [1]. Main advantages include:

- operating-system-independent package API
- [full documentation](https://vampire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with easy-to-read code
- flexible input and filtering options
- flexible plotting options

## Installation

See documentation for [detailed installation guide](https://vampire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html). If Python is installed on your machine, type the following line into your command prompt to install via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/vampire-analysis/):

```bash
pip install vampire-analysis
```

## Getting started

See documentation for detailed guide for basics of [building](https://vampire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/build_basics.html) and [applying](https://vampire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/apply_basics.html) models. If you have `build.xlsx` under `C:\vampire` containing the build image set information, you can build the model with

```python
>>> import pandas as pd  # used to read excel files
>>> import vampire as vp  # recommended import signature

>>> build_df = pd.read_excel(r'C:\vampire\build.xlsx')
>>> vp.model.build_models(build_df, random_state=1)
```

If you have `apply.xlsx` under `C:\vampire` containing the apply image set information, you can apply the model with

```python
>> > apply_df = pd.read_excel(r'C:\vampire\apply.xlsx')
>> > vp.model.transform_datasets(apply_df)
```

Flexible options are provided for [building](https://vampire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/build_advanced.html) and [applying](https://vampire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/apply_advanced.html) models in the advanced section in the documentation.
