# Installation

In this section, we discuss ways to install `vampire-analysis` and best practices.

## Beginner

`vampire-analysis` runs with Python. If we donâ€™t have Python yet, we recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which includes Python and many other packages for data science and scientific computing. Detailed installation instructions can be found in [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

After installation of Anaconda, open the Anaconda command prompt and install `vampire-analysis` via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/vampire-analysis/) by typing:

```bash
pip install vampire-analysis
```

We can now use `vampire-analysis` in the command prompt python interpreter or Jupyter Notebooks.

## Advanced

Installing the package directly may cause dependency conflicts with other packaged. To avoid such problem, we can create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) by `venv`. The following is a quick tutorial on creating a virtual environment. For a detailed walk through, see YouTube videos for [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APOPm01BVrk) and [MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg1Yvry_Ydk).

Suppose we have a project named `my_project` in Windows, we can create a virtual environment by typing in the command line:

```bash
python -m venv my_project\venv
```

We can activate the virtual environment with

```bash
my_project\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

To install `vampire-analysis`, use the above command

```bash
pip install vampire-analysis
```

or for fully reproducible dependencies, use

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

where `requirement.txt` of this project is placed in the current working directory.

We can verify the environment only has necessary packages installed with
the command

```bash
pip list
```

To exit the environment, simply type

```bash
deactivate
```
