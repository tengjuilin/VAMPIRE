# v0.0.1 Release Notes

`vampire-analysis` is a package based on `vampireanalysis` GUI (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-00432-x). The algorithmic operations are isolated from the GUI component and grouped into modules to encourage reuse and improve reproducibility. With extensive documentation and tutorial, `vampire-analysis` provides a flexible alternative to the GUI.

## Changes

### Interface changes from GUI to package

`vampire-analysis` provides package API instead of graphical user interface (GUI).

### Model information stored in files

Information used to build and apply model are now stored in a `.csv` or `.xlsx` file or in a `DataFrame`, instead of being manually inputted when prompted by GUI.

.. seealso::

    :func:`vampire.model.build_models`

    :func:`vampire.model.apply_models`

## New Features

### Option for random state

Option for random state of K-means clustering and plotting representative contours are now to the user for reproducible testing.

.. seealso::

    :func:`vampire.analysis.cluster_contours`

    :func:`vampire.plot.plot_representatives`

### AND filtering of image

Image filename can be screened using AND filtering when building and applying models with optional columns, being more flexible than tags.

.. seealso::

    :func:`vampire.model.build_models`

    :func:`vampire.model.apply_models`

### New PCA implementation

Principal component analysis is widely used in this package. PCA is implemented using singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigen-decomposition, depending on the input matrix. The implementation is faster than the past and `sklearn`.

.. seealso::

    :func:`vampire.amath.pca`

### More plotting options

The package comes with plotting of shape mode distribution, dengrogram, and mean shape mode, in the form of isolated plots and combined plots.

.. seealso::

    :func:`vampire.plot.plot_distribution_contour_dendrogram`

## Improvements

### Defaults for model parameters

Parameters such as `output_path`, `model_name`, `num_points`, and `num_clusters` are given default values. Default values are used when corresponding value is left black in `.csv`/`.xlsx` or being `None`/`np.NaN` in `DataFrame`.

```{seealso}
:func:`vampire.model.build_models`
```

### Performance Improvements

For an image set of 221 images that contains 11173 segmented cells, the performance is as follows:

+------------------------------+------------------+------------------+
|                              | Build model [s]  | Apply model [s]  |
+==============================+==================+==================+
| `vampireanalysis` GUI      | 517              | 98               |
+------------------------------+------------------+------------------+
| `vampire-analysis` package | 80               | 26               |
+------------------------------+------------------+------------------+
| Improvement                  | 85% faster       | 73% faster       |
+------------------------------+------------------+------------------+

## TODO

The very first release of `vampire-analysis` aims to reproduce the result of the `vampireanalysis` GUI. There are a few improvements that can be made in future releases.

### Flexible `num_pc`

Currently, the number of principal component used, `num_pc` is hardcoded as 20, as seen in the GUI implementation. Ideally, the value should change based on the explained variance of the principal components, as described in the paper.

We could also allow the option for user input `num_pc`, where integer in the range (0, 2*num_points] specifies the truncation, and float in the range (0, 1) specifies the percent total variance captured.

### Scree plot for PCA

When using principal component analysis, we usually need scree plot to observe the amount of variance captured in the top few principal components. Support for plotting scree plot and incorporation into the API is needed.
