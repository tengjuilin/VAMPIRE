VAMPIRE (Visually Aided Morpho-Phenotyping Image Recognition) analysis
quantifies and visualizes heterogeneity of cell and nucleus morphology
[1]_. It is used widely in analyzing microglial shape change in response
to oxygen-glucose deprivation [2]_ and morphological changes in cancer
metastasis [3]_.

`vampire-analysis`_ provides a reproducible, fully-documented, and
easy-to-use Python package that is based on the method and software used
the in `vampireanalysis`_ GUI [1]_. Main advantages include:

-  operating-system-independent package API
-  `full documentation`_ with easy-to-read code
-  flexible input and filtering options
-  flexible plotting options

Installation
------------

See documentation for `detailed installation guide`_. If Python is
installed on your machine, type the following line into your command
prompt to install via `PyPI`_:

::

   pip install vampire-analysis

Getting started
---------------

See documentation for detailed guide for basics of `building`_ and
`applying`_ models. If you have ``build.xlsx`` under ``C:\vampire``
containing the build image set information, you can build the model with

.. code:: python

   >>> import pandas as pd  # used to read excel files
   >>> import vampire as vp  # recommended import signature

   >>> build_df = pd.read_excel(r'C:\vampire\build.xlsx')
   >>> vp.model.build_models(build_df, random_state=1)

If you have ``apply.xlsx`` under ``C:\vampire`` containing the apply
image set information, you can apply the model with

.. code:: python

   >>> apply_df = pd.read_excel(r'C:\vampire\apply.xlsx')
   >>> vp.model.apply_models(apply_df)

Flexible options are provided for
`building <https://vampire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/build_advanced.html>`__
and
`applying <https://vampire.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/apply_advanced.html>`__
models in the advanced section in the documentation.
